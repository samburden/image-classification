# Deep Learning - Image Classification project

This is a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) used for classifying images from the [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset.

This project is using Python 3 and needs the following libraries:

* numpy
* sklearn
* tqdm
* matplotlib
* jupyter notebook

These can be installed using pip or conda if using [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

The project is implemented in a Jupyter notebook and can be run using the following from a terminal:

```jupyter notebook dlnd_image_classification.ipynb```
